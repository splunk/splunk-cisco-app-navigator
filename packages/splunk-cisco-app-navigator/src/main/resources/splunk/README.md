# Splunk Cisco App Navigator (SCAN) for Splunk

**Codename:** "The Front Door"  
**Author:** Cisco Systems  
**Version:** 1.0.19  
**Compatibility:** Splunk Enterprise / Splunk Cloud 9.0+

## What It Does

The **Splunk Cisco App Navigator (SCAN)** is the unified "Glass Pane" for the Cisco-Splunk ecosystem. It provides a single Product Catalog UI where Splunk administrators can discover, install, configure, and monitor all Cisco integrations — across Security, Observability, Networking, and Collaboration domains.

Each Cisco product is represented by an **intelligent card** that actively inspects the local Splunk environment and surfaces real-time status: installed apps, available upgrades, data flow validation, and legacy debt detection.

## Getting Started

1. Install the app on your Splunk Search Head (or Search Head Cluster).
2. Open the app — the **Products** page is your landing view.
3. Browse the **Available Products** catalog and click **+ Add** to add products to your workspace.
4. Use **Install** buttons to install the required add-ons and visualization apps directly from Splunkbase.
5. Click **Launch** to open dashboards for configured products.
6. Use the **Secure Networking** pill to filter products by Cisco's Secure Networking GTM strategy.

## Key Features

### Product Catalog
- **93 Cisco products** across 4 categories: **Security** (43), **Networking** (35), **Observability** (3), **Collaboration** (12).
- **19 subcategories** for granular filtering within Security, Networking, Collaboration, and Observability.
- **Product lifecycle tracking** via `date_created` and `date_updated` fields on every product card.

### Product Sections
- **Configured Products** — Products the user has added to their workspace.
- **Detected Products** — Products with live data flowing (auto-detected via sourcetype scan).
- **Available Products** — Products available for deployment with supported Splunk add-ons.
- **Integration Needed** — Cisco products without a dedicated Splunk integration (visible in dev/GTM mode).
- **Coming Soon** — Products under active development.
- **Deprecated Products** — Add-ons being sunset or replaced.
- **Retired Products** — Cisco products that have reached end-of-life.
- **GTM Roadmap — Coverage Gaps** — Products in the Secure Networking GTM with no Splunk coverage yet.
- **Custom Products** — Customer-created product cards stored in `local/products.conf`.

### Optimized Data Validation (MTTI)
- **Single search** validates all 293+ unique sourcetypes across products in one SPL query.
- Uses `| metadata type=sourcetypes` for sub-second validation.
- Results distributed to individual cards — green (data flowing), orange (orphaned), or yellow (no data).
- **Mean Time to Innocence (MTTI):** Proves data flow instantly to eliminate finger-pointing.

### FilterDrawer (Sidebar)
- Sidebar drawer with advanced filters: support level, visibility toggles, onboarding (SC4S/NetFlow), platform, version compatibility.
- "No Integration" support level pill (visible in dev/GTM mode only).
- ActiveFilterChips bar shows selected filters with clear-all.
- Splunkbase CSV sync button inside drawer.

### Category Filter Bar

- **Cross-cutting filters**: Secure Networking (71), SOAR (12), Alert Actions, AI-Powered (17), ES (25), ITSI (6), SC4S (18), NetFlow (11).
- Each filter pill shows a live count of matching products.

### Universal Finder (Search Bar)
